You choose 1 dataset out of the 3 provided in the dataset subfolder.

Then you must build a clustering model in clustering.ipynb, without using any machine-learning library for the model itself. (Choose a good one for me)

You are allowed to use pandas and numpy.

After that, you need to optimize your model. (Choose a RELATIVELY NICHE (but performant) optimization method for me)

Finally, you must present your model’s results in report.md, and explain why the clustering turned out that way.

For context, this assignment is for a "Optimization Methods" course final project, so you must make it as GOOD as possible.

And for reference, here are the learning materials on our course (please feel free to use methods outside of this outline, it's just a guide of sorts, really):

- Graphical Method

- Simplex Method

- Gradient Descent

- Flower Pollination Algorithm

- Lagrange Multiplier

- Karush–Kuhn–Tucker

- Genetic Algorithm

- Ant Colony Optimization

- Dynamic Programming

- Ranking Method

- Sequential Method
